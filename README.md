# 🌟 Oasis Infobyte Internship – Data Science Tasks

Welcome to my project repository for the Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship Program. This repository showcases the tasks I completed during the internship, reflecting core competencies in data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning.

Each task is structured to address real-world problems through data-driven solutions using Python and relevant libraries.

Task 2: Unemployment Analysis
📁 Folder: Task-2:Unemployment_Analysis

Task 3: Car Price Prediction
📁 Folder: Task-3-Car-Price-Prediction

Task 5: Sales Prediction
📁 Folder: Task-5-Sales-Prediction

Programming:
  Python 3 – Core programming language for analysis and modeling
  Google Colab – Cloud-based notebook environment for writing and executing code
  Jupyter Notebook – Interactive development environment for local execution

📚 Python Libraries:
  Pandas – Data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis
  NumPy – Numerical operations and array handling
  Matplotlib – Basic and advanced static data visualization
  Seaborn – Enhanced statistical visualizations (heatmaps, lineplots, etc.)
  Scikit-learn – Machine learning models and performance evaluation
    Linear Regression
    Random Forest Regressor
    Metrics: R² Score, MAE, MAPE, RMSE

📊 Visualization Tools:
Line Charts – Trend analysis (e.g., unemployment over time)
Bar Graphs – Region-wise comparisons
Heatmaps – Correlation analysis
Scatter Plots – Prediction vs actual sales/cost values
